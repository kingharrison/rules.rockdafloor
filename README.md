## General Rules

The rules outlined on this site are designed with the growth, safety, and long-term development of the breaking community in mind. As breaking continues to evolve as both an art form and competitive sport, these rules serve as a foundation to promote fairness, consistency, and respect across all levels of participation.

Our primary goals are:

* To Grow the Sport: By creating a clear and accessible framework, we aim to welcome new dancers, organizers, and communities while preserving the essence and culture of breaking.
* To Ensure Safety: Breaking involves dynamic, high-impact movement. These rules include safety guidelines that protect dancers, judges, and spectators, ensuring everyone can engage in breaking with confidence.
* To Support Progression: Whether someone is new to the cypher or preparing for high-level battles, the rules are structured to support skill development through age-appropriate expectations, progression-based divisions, and pathways that encourage personal and competitive growth.

Breaking is for everyone. These rules are a tool—not a limitation—to help dancers push boundaries while maintaining respect for the culture, the competition, and each other.

### Documents

Below are links to the RDF documents to help prepare and run a battle. 

* [Cypher Prelim Judges Form PDF](https://rules.rockdafloor.com/Cypher_Prelims_Judges_Form.pdf) - Use this sheet to judge all dancers within the cypher prelims. Judges may go by whole numbers 1-10, half numbers 1-10 (6.5, 7.5, etc..), or one decimal place (9.4, 8.2, etc). 
* [Top 8 Bracket PDF](https://rules.rockdafloor.com/Top_8_Bracket.pdf) - Bracket sheets are built to be in segments of 8. 
* [Battle Plan PDF](https://rules.rockdafloor.com/Battle_Plan.pdf) - A Battle Plan is to help dancers learn to organize their skills to use for all battles. It is not meant to be a hard script, but more a dynamic template as dancers progress and learn how to use their moves as the times that make the most impact. 

### Safety

The safety of every dancer is a top priority. While breaking is an expressive and physically demanding art form, it must be approached with discipline and awareness to prevent injury.

Dancers are strongly encouraged to perform and compete only with moves and skills that are within their current level of training and proficiency. Attempting advanced skills too early—before proper strength, control, and technique are developed—can lead to serious injury or even death. For this reason, skills performed outside a dancer’s declared level will not be recognized during competition.

Proper attire is also essential to safety. Because every dancer’s style and movement vary, there is no one-size-fits-all dress code. However, dancers must avoid wearing items that present a hazard, including:

* Clothing with hard elements that may obstruct movement
* Jewelry that can catch or snag during dynamic motion
* Loose or oversized accessories that can impair vision or control

Each dancer is responsible for ensuring that their attire supports freedom of movement while minimizing the risk of entanglement or injury.

For younger dancers, coaches and guardians play a critical role in helping ensure safety. They are expected to guide skill selection, monitor progression, and ensure appropriate supervision and attire are in place. Encouraging safe practices not only protects the dancer—it sets the foundation for a long, sustainable journey in breaking.

Breaking is about pushing limits—but it must be done with care, respect for the body, and commitment to long-term progression.

Dancers are not allowed to physically touch any other dancer while battling. The only exception is interaction within their own crew while in the crew battle. The battle host may warn dancers who violate this rule, and have the right to disqualify any dancer who refuses to follow this rule. 

### Skill Recognition

Each skill level is defined by specific criteria and only skills within the designated level are recognized. Performing a skill above the assigned level does not result in a penalty; however, judges are instructed to disregard the move as if it had not occurred.

Example: If a competitor registers for the Beginner level and performs Air Flares, the judges will not acknowledge the move. While the audience may react positively, and even the judges may appreciate the difficulty of the skill, it will hold no value in determining who wins. For judging purposes, the competitor’s performance during the execution of the Air Flares is equivalent to standing still. As a result, a competitor who demonstrates skills aligned with the Beginner level will have a competitive advantage and be more likely to win the battle.

### Divisions

Dancers will be divided up into their respoective skill level and age level. Ages can always compete up, but never down. Gender splits may occur at the Battle Hosts preference if there are at least 4 dancers to support each split. 

* Lil Breakers: Age 5-7
* Youth: Age 7-13
* Teen: Age 13-18
* Adult: Age 18+

### Number Of Dancers

The minimum amount of dancers within a level and division to run a Cypher prelims and Top 8 Bracket is 4. If you have less than 4 dancers, you may use alternative methods to determine your placements in battle. 

* 3 Dancers Suggestion - Use a Round Robin approach (each dancer battles the other two) to determine placements. 
* 2 Dancers Suggestion - Use a multi battle strategy where they can compete for best of 3 battles.

### Cypher

Every Cypher must provide a smooth safe surface for each dancer to safely perform any breaking move. The area must be clear of all obstructions and have a defined and easily understood outer barrier where the dancers know they can perform and the audience knows to stay out. The Cypher must have an area at least 12' by 12'. 

### Prelims

All dancers within a level will perform, one by one and organized by a list managed by the Cypher MC, in front of the judges. The judges will assign a value of 1-10 (using halfs or decimals depending on how many dancers are competing) to each dancer as they perform. These values are added up, and the dancers are organized from highest to smallest total. Where the dancer falls within that list determines their ranking for brackets. The dancer with the highest prelim score will be the #1 seed. The second highest score would be the #2 seed. If there were 20 dancers that are competing the lowest scored dancer would be the #20 seed. 

### Brackets

All dancers within a level and age group will be divided into their own Top 8 Bracket. The bracket positions will be decided based on the dancers seeding from prelims. When looking at the bracket you will see the top see (#1 seed) will first battle the lowest seed (#8). The second seed (#2 seed) will battle the second lowest seed (#7). This rewards each seed by placing the highest performing dancer and giving them the statistically 'easiest path' to the finals, and sets up the final battle to be the most competitive. 

#### Byes

If there are not enough division to fill a bracket, you will use 'byes' to fill in the lowest seeded spots. 

**Example**

There are 6 dancers within a division. Seed #7 and seed #8 will be filled in as 'byes' on the Top 8 Bracket form. This means seed #1 and seed #2 get a bye on Round 1, and immediately make it to the Semi Finals. 

#### Multiple Brackets For Same Level And Division

If there is more than 8 dancers within a level and division you will be creating multiple Top 8 Brackets for dancers to compete in. How the brackets are divded is listed below:

*  9 dancers - The 'A' Bracket will get 5 dancers and the 'B' Bracket will get 4 dancers
* 10 dancers - The 'A' Bracket will get 5 dancers and the 'B' Bracket will get 5 dancers
* 11 dancers - The 'A' Bracket will get 6 dancers and the 'B' Bracket will get 5 dancers
* 12 dancers - The 'A' Bracket will get 6 dancers and the 'B' Bracket will get 6 dancers
* 13 dancers - The 'A' Bracket will get 7 dancers and the 'B' Bracket will get 6 dancers
* 14 dancers - The 'A' Bracket will get 7 dancers and the 'B' Bracket will get 7 dancers
* 15 dancers - The 'A' Bracket will get 8 dancers and the 'B' Bracket will get 7 dancers
* 16 dancers - The 'A' Bracket will get 8 dancers and the 'B' Bracket will get 8 dancers
* 17 dancers - At this point there is always enough to fill the 'A' Bracket. You will fill the 'A' Bracket with the Top 8 seeds, and then divide the rest of the dancers between a 'B' and 'C' bracket. If there were enough dancers to always fill the 'B' Bracket as well (24+ dancers), you would always fill the 'A' and 'B' Brackets, and divide the dancers between a 'C' and 'D' bracket. This pattern continues on as the amount of dancers grow. 

## Levels

To support fair competition and healthy progression, dancers may choose to compete in any level that reflects their current ability—except for the Intro level, which is reserved exclusively for dancers in their first year of breaking. This level exists to provide a welcoming space for true beginners to grow alongside others at a similar stage.

Each level is defined by a set of recognized skills. If a dancer performs skills above the level they’ve registered for, judges are instructed to ignore those moves entirely. This allows dancers to focus on mastery and style within their chosen level, rather than being rewarded for prematurely attempting advanced tricks.

The Pro level is unique in that it recognizes the professional level of Breaking. It is the only level to allow monetary prizes. 

### Intro

The Intro level has all the same skill recognitions as beginner, but is only open to athletes that are within their first year of breaking. 

Battle Rounds Up To 20 Seconds

## Crew Showcase Routines and Battles Overview

Crew battles are one of the most exciting parts of breaking—where teamwork, creativity, and performance come together on the floor. It’s not just about individual skills—it’s about chemistry, timing, and the story your crew tells through movement.

For the 2025–2026 season, each crew may have up to five dancers on the floor during their Showcase Routine. Crews will have up to 2½ minutes to perform a choreographed Showcase Routine to music provided by the crew. Judges will watch the full performance and score it based on execution, originality, synchronization, use of breaking elements, and overall impact.

After all crews have performed and the scores are tabulated, the top-scoring teams will move into battle rounds to determine the winner. At minimum, the top 2 crews will advance. If participation allows, we will expand to top 4 or top 8 for bracket-style battles.

Crew routines should be a showcase of unity, style, and stage presence—this is your moment to shine together. For this first season there is no level separation between crews.

### Crew Showcase Routine Rules

All routines must be 2:30 minutes or less. For every full 5 seconds over the 2:30 a crew is still performing, the final placement will be lowered by one. Timing of the routine will be measured from the first sound / noise / piece of music from the routine before performed. 

Showcase Routines may contain up to 5 people in the performance at one time. The same 5 dancers that start the routine must remain the same the entire routine (no substituting dancers in and out during the routine). Routines may use less than 5 dancers, but must have at least 3 to be a crew.

If there are 3 or more crews performing Showcase Routines, only the top routines will be selected to move on to the Battle rounds. Performance and placement of their Showcase Routine will determine seeding for the battle round, but will not have any other carry over for battles. 

If there are only 2 crews performing Showcase Routines, the winner will get one point. As there are only two crews, they will both move on and battle. The winner of the crew battle will also receive one point. If the two crews split the points, there will be a 1v1 battle between each crews best dancer. The winner of this 1v1 will determine the crew winner. 

### Crew Battle Rules

Each crew will have 3 total rounds to battle another crew. Judges will award, per judge, one point to either crew each round. The winner of the crew battle will have the most points. 

Each side will get up to 1 minute per round for their crew to perform. 

No assisted tumbling (example: toe pitch back tucks) are allowed. All other breaking safety rules are allowed. 

## Skill Development

Though there are defined guidelines for each level of competition, each breaker and each school will develop progressions and skills in an order that most benefits their students. We have created a Skill Progress Sheet so that each school can tailor the skills individually for each breaker, and mark as they attain those skills. Notice the skill sheet does not specifically refer to how a skill should look, but how well they perform the skill in the eyes of the coach / studio. There is recognition for attempting a skill as just attempting takes effort and encourages development. 

* [Skill Progress Sheet PDF](https://rules.rockdafloor.com/Skill_Progress_Sheet.pdf) - Use this sheet to create a list of skills for a BBoy or Bgirl and mark their progress so they (and their parents) can see development.
