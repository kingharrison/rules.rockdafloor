## General Rules

### Safety

### Skill Recognition

Each skill level is defined by specific criteria and only skills within the designated level are recognized. Performing a skill above the assigned level does not result in a penalty; however, judges are instructed to disregard the move as if it had not occurred.
Example: If a competitor registers for the Beginner level and performs Air Flares, the judges will not acknowledge the move. While the audience may react positively, and even the judges may appreciate the difficulty of the skill, it will hold no value in determining who wins. For judging purposes, the competitor’s performance during the execution of the Air Flares is equivalent to standing still. As a result, a competitor who demonstrates skills aligned with the Beginner level will have a competitive advantage and be more likely to win the battle.

### Cypher

### Brackets

## Intro

The Intro level has all the same skill recognitions as beginner, but is only open to athletes that are within their first year of breaking.

## How to run locally? :dart:

  Make sure you have [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [git](https://git-scm.com/) installed.

  ```bash
  node --version
  git --version
  ```

- Clone the repository :
    - With HTTPS:
      ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/JayantGoel001/JayantGoel001.github.io.git
      ```
    - With SSH:
      ```bash
      git@github.com:JayantGoel001/JayantGoel001.github.io.git
      ```
      
- Navigate to working Directory and **main** branch

	```bash
	cd JayantGoel001.github.io
	git switch main
	```

- Install the dependencies:

  ```bash
  npm install -f
  ```
	- Installs all the dependencies required by the project.


- Fire up a development server:

  ```bash
  ng serve
  ```
    - Runs the app in the `development` mode.
    - Open [http://localhost:4200/](http://localhost:4200/) to view it in the Default Browser.
    - The page will reload if you make edits.
    - You will also see any lint errors in the console.


- Deploy code to GitHub Pages (gh-pages):
  
  ```bash
  ng deploy --base-href="/"
  ```
    - Builds the application for production to the `build` folder & deploys application on `GitHub Pages`.
    - It correctly bundles Angular in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
    - The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
  

- Create a new branch:

  ```bash
  git checkout -b "<NAME-OF-THE-BRANCH>"
  ```

- Add, Commit & Push the local changes to remote repository:

  ```bash
  git add .
  git commit -m "<COMMIT-MESSAGE>"
  git push origin <NAME-OF-THE-BRANCH>
  ```

**For Docker Users**

## Search engine optimization(SEO) :spider:

Search engine optimization (SEO) is the process of improving the quality and quantity of website traffic to a website or a web page from search engines.
Add the below code snippet to `src/index.html` with your site info. This step is not mandatory.

```html
<meta itemprop="name" content="--- YOUR TITLE ---">
<meta itemprop="description" content="--- SITE DESCRIPTION ---">
<meta itemprop="url" content="--- YOUR SITE URL ---"/>
<meta itemprop="image" content="--- YOUR IMAGE ---">
